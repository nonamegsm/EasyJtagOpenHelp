  <p>The most convenient way to replace a memory card in Apple devices is to replace it with iTunes. Using official software avoids unnecessary errors and installs the original firmware in the refurbished device.</p>
  <p>The only problem in this case is copying the serial data needed to further activate and use the device. To successfully copy and record serial data, you need to remember the following features:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Each generation of devices has a clear list of usable memory cards. Before selecting a card, make sure it&#39;s right for the device.</li>
    <li>Each generation of devices for each memory card model has a unique storage unit for serial information. Thus, you can only fully copy a block with serial information on a map of the exact same model.</li>
    <li>Devices are separated by discharge by generation:
      <ul>
        <li>Devicesx32: - iPad2 - iPad3 - iPad4 - iPhone4s - iPhone5 - iPhone5c - mini1</li>
        <li>Devices x64: - iPad5 - iPad6 - iPadAir - iPadAir2 - iPhone5s - iPhone6 - iPhone6P - mini2 - mini3 - mini4</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Devices have different storage patterns. Thus, if you move a map from one model to another, you may need pre-formatting. You can format the map with iTunes, erase it completely enough and restore it with iTunes. Also, this action may be necessary when using a new (clean) card.</li>
    <li>When you restore your device with iTunes, auto-rotation information is copied to iOS, where it is stored encrypted and where it will be read the next time you use iTunes. So if you need to change the auto-rotational information, you need to not only change it in the auto-rotation block, but also remove it from the OS. The easy way to do this is to completely erase the memory.</li>
    <li>
      <p>In some cases, when replacing the memory card, you should change the device&#39;s model according to <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Models" target="_blank">Apple model list</a>. Sometimes this leads to errors in recovery through iTunes.</p>

    <li>Remove the memory card from the device and read from it auto-rotation allotoninformation. Or get information in any other way.</li>
    <li>Install a new memory card in your device and format (restore) it with iTunes before you erase it.</li>
    <li>Remove the memory card and write it auto-rotation alloton information. Not forgetting to delete OS data.</li>
    <li>Restore your device with iTunes.<br />

  <p>The suite has created a separate tab. To choose from, go to the NAND toolbar tab and then select the iConfig tab.</p>
  <p><img src="images/Apple_PPN_iConfig_Screen.jpg" /></p>
  <p>The working area can be divided into four parts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>NAND General is a global panel for all NAND tabs, allowing you to identify the memory card, as well as adjust the frequency and voltage. Error management options don&#39;t affect iConfig.</li>
    <li>
      <p>IConfig&#39;s display and settings area. This area displays Apple&#39;s auto-rotation al-data for this map or settings file. Please note that identification does not change information in these fields.</p>
      <p>The information entered into the field data will be used on the recording and will replace the information in the iConfig memory card. If you don&#39;t want to change values in a field, just leave it empty.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that this panel stores all possible options iConfig. As mentioned above, the same memory card model can be used in different devices, and as a result, can have different ways of storing iConfig. To view all iConfig, use the Drop list mode in this area. Attention! Mode in this area only switches information about iConfig, but does not affect its record.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The iConfig reading and selection area allows you to read the data (Read iConfig button) and save the areas with them (Read and save iConfig area). Saving takes place in master iConfig file, which automatically opens the program after the save.</p>
      <p>In this area, you can select files with area data (iConfig area) that will be recorded, as well as open the previously saved Master iConfig file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The iConfig recording area lets you set up Write Mode. Most often, the cards have one recording mode for each discharge (x32 or x64). However, sometimes there are cards with two recording modes for each of the discharges. To choose the right one, just read the formatted (restored) map with iTunes and see in which case a more complete block of data has returned.</p>
      <p>The Erase data option includes a complete cleaning (erasure) of the card before recording or stering the iConfig area.</p>
      <p>The Fix iConfig button changes the iConfig data recorded in the map, but doesn&#39;t change the rest of the data in the storage area (iConfig area). Convenient to work with a map that&#39;s already been restored with iTunes.</p>
      <p>The Erase all iConfig areas button removes everything you can for this iConfig area. Lets you start the iConfig area recovery process with iTunes.</p>
      <p>The Write iConfig area from files is completely rewrites iConfig area data and replaces it with file data listed in the previous area. When you write, iConfig data is replaced in the iConfig area in the same way as Fix iConfig. It can be useful when cloning a map or if necessary to record your data. It is worth recalling that the iConfig area is interchangeable only for the same map model and only within one generation of devices.</p>
      <p>The Write iConfig for Selected Device button maps the iConfig area we&#39;ve prepared for the Device device we select in the field and the map we use. This changes iConfig</p>
      <p>iConfig area. This mode is needed to record data on a new map and allows you to do without pre-formatting with iTunes.</p>

    <li>Remove an old memory card from your device.</li>
    <li>Identify it (Identify NAND Chip button).</li>
    <li>Read and save the iConfig area (Read and save iConfig area).</li>
    <li>Identify a new card (Identify NAND Chip button).</li>
    <li>Read iConfig (Read iConfig button). If a new map is taken from a device on the same model, we go straight to p.14.</li>
    <li>Erase data from the card (Erase all iConfig areas button with Erase data enabled).</li>
    <li>Restore iConfig area with iTunes (install map into device and restore when iTunes).</li>
    <li>Remove the map and read iConfig (Read iConfig button). If iConfig is successfully read, let&#39;s move on to p.14.</li>
    <li>Fill iConfig fields manually or open Master iConfig file (saved in p.3).</li>
    <li>Record, prepared by us, iConfig area. To do this, you need to choose a recording mode (Write Mode), select a device ,Device), set the Erase data option and click Write iConfig for Selected Device.</li>
    <li>Restore to install using iTunes (install map into device and run iTunes).</li>
    <li>Check the device after recovery, in case the data is recovered correctly moving on to p.18.</li>
    <li>Remove the map and read iConfig (Read iConfig button). In the case of iConfig reading, we move on to p.14. </li>
    <li>Fill iConfig fields manually or open Master iConfig file (saved in p.3).</li>
    <li>Change iConfig data. To do this, you need to choose a write mode (Write Mode), set Erase data and click iConfig.</li>
    <li>Install a map and start the recovery using iTunes.</li>
    <li>Check the device after recovery. If the recovery went wrong, a different non-standard solution is needed. Save the work log and Master iConfig file and get in touch to further address this issue.</li>
    <li>Enjoy your work device!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can also use a simplified algorithm to just skip the items from 6 to 8 inclusive. This will save time and reduce the risks of damaging the device while installing and removing the memory card. But, in some non-standard cases, you need to use iConfig area restoration with iTunes (p.6-8).</p>
