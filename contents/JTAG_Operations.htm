<h1>JTAG Operations</h1>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans"><font size="3" face="Open Sans">JTAG is a
hardware interface for programming, testing and debugging printed circuit
boards.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans">Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) is the common
name used for a debugging, programming, and testing interface typically found
on microcontrollers, ASICs, and FPGAs. It enables all components with this
interface to be tested, programmed, and/or debugged using a single connector on
a PC board which can daisy chain them together.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans">The JTAG interface has a number of lines
that are used and together these are collectively known as the Test Access
Port, TAP. This JTAG port is used for JTAG control as w</font><font size="3" face="Open Sans">ell as providing connections by which the serial data may
enter and leave the board.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans"><strong>Test Access Port
(TAP)</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans">The boundary-scan control signals,
collectively referred to as the Test Access Port (TAP), define a serial
protocol for scan-based devices. There are five pins:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TCK (clock) synchronizes
the internal state machine operations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMS (mode) select is sampled at the rising edge of TCK to
determine the next state.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TDI (data in) is sampled at the rising edge of TCK and
shifted into the device's test or programming logic when the internal state
machine is in the correct state.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TDO (data out) represents the data shifted out of the
device's test or programming logic and is valid on the falling edge of TCK when
the internal state machine is in the correct state.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRST (reset), optional, when driven low, resets the internal
state machine.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans">The TCK, TMS, and TRST input pins drive a
16-state TAP controller state machine. The TAP controller manages the exchange
of data and instructions. The controller advances to the next state based on
the value of the TMS signal at each rising edge of TCK.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans">With the proper wiring, you can test
multiple ICs or boards simultaneously. An external file, known as a
Boundary-Scan Description Language (BSDL) file, defines the capabilities of
a</font><font size="3" face="Open Sans">ny single device's boundary-scan
logic.</font></p>
<p><span><font size="3" face="Open Sans"><strong>JTAG
Connector</strong></font></span></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Open Sans">There is no standard JTAG connector or
pinout, so suppliers are able to define their own.</font></p>
