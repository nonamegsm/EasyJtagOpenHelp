<p><strong>ADB</strong> - allows you to work with the device&#39;s memory through
the ADB interface: Android Debugging Bridge, which is enabled in the device in
the Developer Setting &gt; USB Debuging.<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="images/USB_ADB.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>Detect ADB</strong> - find/connect to the ADB interface of the
device;<br/>
<strong>Detect Part.</strong> - identify device sections;<br/>
<strong>Dump Part.</strong> - read and save the selected section;<br/>
<strong>Read extCSD</strong> - read the configuration of the registers extCSD
of the microchips memory device (eMMC) to the file;<br/>
<strong>Limit Dump Size To</strong> - limits the size of the selected
section;<br/>
<strong>Partition List</strong> - illustrates the Symlink, Name, Size and
Offset of partitions.</p>

<strong>QC EDL</strong> tab is working with <strong>Qualcomm</strong>
processors.</p>
<p><img src="images/USB_QC EDL.jpg"/></p>
<p>Qualcomm processors have a service mode that can be accessed by shortening a
test pins.<br/>
</p>
<p>Than the processor goes into boot mode and allows user to record the
bootloader and trough it to perform the settings.<br/>
</p>
<p>The sequence of operations :<br/>
1) <strong>Port</strong> - Allows to select a specific device (phone) that is
connected via USB.<br/>
The button on the right allows to update the list of connected devices and
automatically select the first QDLoader 9008 (the phone is in service
mode).<br/>
2) <strong>Identify</strong> - allows to get the device status, ID and
hash.<br/>
3) <strong>Loader</strong> - allows to select one of the compatible (by ID and
hash) loaders from EasyJtag database, or use the Custom button to select the
user bootloader in the box below.<br/>
4) The next time click the <strong>Identify</strong> button, a corresponding
bootloader will be loaded into the device, allowing user to work with
memory.<br/>
<strong>Reset Device</strong> - in some loaders and phones it allows you to
switch from service mode to working mode. It doesn&#39;t always work, it&#39;s the
features of a particular phone and Loader;<br/>
<strong>Read Info</strong> - reloading partitions;<br/>
<strong>Write Target</strong> – write to device.   The nuance of
WriteMode:<br/>
<strong>Write Binary Raw to 0 sector</strong> - offset linear recording;<br/>
<strong>Write XML Write by vendor</strong> - parses the main firmware file and
writes the corresponding files to the specified offsets;<br/>
<strong>Write by partition name</strong> - reads GPT from a device, locates a
file with the same name in the selected folder and writes to it;<br/>
<strong>GPT Backup Writing</strong> – backup the GPT;<br/>
<strong>Read RAW</strong> – linear reading;<br/>
<strong>Read XML</strong> - reads files by analogy as they are placed in the
firmware;<br/>
<strong>Unlock User</strong> - attempt to reset the user&#39;s password;<br/>
<strong>Stop Operation</strong> – stops the device operation.</p>
<p><strong>LG LAF</strong> - LG Advanced Flash. LG has developed e technology
that greatly simplifies the replacement of system firmware in the device. This
technology is called &quot;LAF&quot; (LG Advanced Flash).</p>
<p>Initially, LAF technology was developed for LG service centers. In
particular, it allowed to restore working capacity of LG mobile devices which
do not turn on and do not react to attempts to turn them on (often mobile
devices go into this state when trying to increase user&#39;s privileges in their
operating system or in the case of errors in updating the system software
produced by Unqualified users). However, a large number of utilities that use
this technology appeared quite quickly outside specialized service centers for
flashing the modified system software of LG mobile devices.</p>
<p><img src="images/USB_LG LAF.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>Detect LAF</strong> - Detect LG Device Info (Partitions / Android
version);<br/>
<strong>Read RAW</strong> - Read dump from LG Device. If you are reading a full
dump, you need select &quot;Write binary at RAW mode&quot;. Also you need to select a
size of write.<br/>
<strong>Format User</strong> - User Custom Data formating;<br/>
<strong>Clear FRP</strong> - FRP Data erasing;<br/>
<strong>Clear User Lock</strong> - User Password / Key erasing;<br/>
<strong>Stop Operation</strong> - button for interrupting / canceling the
performed read / clear / write operations.</p>
<p>There is an alternative instruction for transferring a LG mobile device to
the Download mode published on the site &quot;LG Download Mode utility and
documentation&quot;  [ <font color="#548dd4">https://github.com/Leken
steyn/lglaf</font> ].</p>
<p>- Turn off the mobile device.</p>
<p>- Connect the mobile device yo the computer using the <strong>USB
cable</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="images/LG_DeviceUSBconnected.png"/><br/>
 </p>
<p>- Press and hold the <strong>Volume Up</strong> key.</p>
<p>- Click on the <strong>&quot;Start&quot; (&quot;Power&quot;)</strong> button.</p>
<p>- Wait for the mobile device to display the message <strong>&quot;Download
mode&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>- Release the <strong>Volume Up</strong> key.</p>
<p>You should see the inscription on the screen of the mobile device:
<strong>&quot;Firmware Update&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/LG_LAF_FirmwareUpdateMode.png"/></p>
<p><strong>The image on the LG phone screen switched into the “Firmware Update”
mode.</strong></p>
<p>In mobile devices with the Android operating system version 6, it is
possible to save application data not in the phone’s memory, but in the cloud
[ <font color="#548dd4">https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html</font>
]</p>
<p>Therefore, the process of extracting user data from a mobile device may fail
due to the fact that initially this data was not stored in the device. In this
situation, you can use the functionality of the program “Mobile forensics”,
which allows you to restore users’ names and passwords from cloud storage (or
to find cloud storage tokens in your device) and access the device data stored
in the clouds.</p>
