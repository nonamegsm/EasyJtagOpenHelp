  <h1>What is the eMMC</h1>
  <p><strong style="font-size: 11pt;">eMMC</strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> is an embedded storage solution with an MMC interface, flash memory and controller, all in a small BGA package. It is based upon the JEDEC industry-standard MMC System Specification v4.3/4.41/4.5/5.0/5.1 and JEDEC BGA packaging standards. With interface speeds from 52 MB (v4.3) up to 400 MB (v5.0) per second, eMMC provides fast scalable performance.</span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>eMMC provides a flexible, industry-standard architecture that simplifies mass storage designs for portable consumer electronics products. With eMMC, a host system can now gain access to all major classes of massstorage memory subsystems, including embedded memory (eMMC), memory cards or even hard disk drives (via ATA-on-MMC specification) with one common MMC Interface Protocol Bus.</p>

  <p>eMMC v5.1 is the latest specification defined by JEDEC and is designed to meet the requirements for next level of high performance data transfer for mobile electronic products. With its low-pin count, higher bandwidth, multiple boot mechanisms, and content security features, eMMC 5.1 Device provides an easy migration path and greatly simplifies system design for new products and is backward compatible to previous versions.</p>
