  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>4) Hardware Partitions</strong> - creation and configuration of eMMC hardware partitions (ROM2 / 3, GP1-4).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="eMMC Hardware Partitions" src="assets/images/eMMC_HW Partitions.jpg" title="eMMC Hardware Partitions"/></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Consists of two sections:</p>
  <p><strong>Samsung Boot+RPMB sizes</strong> - allows user to resize Boot1 / 2 (ROM2 / 3) and RPMB areas only for Samsung eMMC revisions below 5.1 (not including rev 5.1).</p>
  <p><strong>ROM2, ROM2 size, RPMB Block Size</strong> - selection of partition sizes;</p>
  <p><strong>Write to extCSD</strong> - write selected sizes to extCSD.</p>
  <p><strong style="color: rgb(255,0,0)">Important:</strong> when recording a new configuration, Wipe eMMC occurs, i.e. erasing all data from the eMMC, and on some eMMC the information on the GP1-4 partitions can be erased.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#f53752">Important:</span> if, after this operation, the sizes of ROM2 / 3 / RPMB do not correspond to the selected ones, this means that this microcircuit does not support the selected sizes and the operation should be repeated, reducing the sizes.</p>
  <p><strong>JEDEC GP Partition sizes</strong> - creation of partitions GP1-4 for chips in which the value of the extCSD register (155 / 0x9B) - PARTITON_SETTING_COMPLETED is equal to &quot;0x00&quot;.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Important:</span> </span>the creation of partitions &quot;GP1-4&quot; is due to the reduction in the size of &quot;User / ROM1&quot; (cut off from it).</p>
  <p><strong>GP1-4 Part Size</strong> - selection of sizes of future sections;</p>
  <p><strong>ENH GP1-4</strong> - increases the reliability of the partition for MLC / TLC memory by switching it to SLC / MLC mode. The amount of memory allocated for the partition is 2 times larger than the selected size;</p>
  <p><strong>WR_REL GP1-4</strong> - sets the recording mode to the GP1-4 sections, which increases the reliability of data recording to prevent data loss during recording (the mode when the old data of the recorded block is not erased and new ones are written to the spare place);</p>
  <p><strong>User Enhanced Start / Size</strong> - turning the beginning of the User / ROM1 section into Enhanced mode, similar to ENH GP1-4 (address and length are selected);</p>
  <p><strong>Set WR_REL User</strong> - sets the recording mode in the same way as WR_REL GP1-4 for the User / ROM1 section.</p>
  <p><strong>Test Setting</strong> - write selected parameters to extCSD, without setting the extCSD register (155 / 0x9B) - PARTITON_SETTING_COMPLETED to &quot;0x00&quot;;</p>
  <p><strong>Write to extCSD</strong> - the final record of the selected parameters in extCSD, with the extCSD register (155 / 0x9B) - PARTITON_SETTING_COMPLETED set to &quot;0x01&quot;, after which operations to change the areas of &quot;GP1-4&quot; can not be changed.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>5) OTP</strong> - One Time Programmable, contains<strong> Info</strong>  panel, <strong>Read and Write</strong> panel and <strong>OTP Config </strong>panel.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="eMMC OTP" src="assets/images/eMMC_OTP.jpg" title="eMMC OTP" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Info </strong>panel contain<strong> Scan for OTP</strong> button and <strong>OTP Offset </strong>box.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Scan for OTP</strong>  - scans entire eMMC address space for OTP (One Time Programmable) area or multiple OTP areas. Results are printed in a log window if such areas detected.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Read and Write </strong>panel contain <strong>OTP Data</strong> file box and  <strong>Read  OTP Region</strong><strong>, Write OTP Region</strong> buttons:</p>
  <p><strong>OTP Data file</strong> - box selection for writing OTP area of eMMC;</p>
  <p><strong>Read OTP Region</strong> button - reads contents of OTP are in selected file;</p>
  <p><strong>Write OTP Region</strong> button - writes a file to OTP region by provided address. Operation is possible only if OTP region is not locked permanently.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>OTP Config</strong> panel:</p>
  <p><strong>Lock OTP</strong> -  set protection flag for provided in Offset box address.</p>
  <p><strong>Unlock OTP</strong> - clear protection flag for provided on offset box address. Possible only if protection flag is not permanent. Otherwise can be cleared only by eMMC 4.5 firmware update of factory reset on Samsung eMMC chips.</p>
  <p><strong>Temporary:</strong> Write and Erase prevention scheme that can be enabled and disabled.</p>
  <p><strong>Power-on:</strong> Write and Erase prevention scheme, which once enabled, cannot be reversed untill a power failure event that causes the device to reboot occurs or the device is reset using the reset pin.</p>
  <p><strong>Permanent:</strong> Write and Erase prevention scheme, which once enabled, cannot be reversed.</p>
